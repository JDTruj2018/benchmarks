Purpose
=======

From their [site]_:

   SPARTA is an acronym for **S**\ tochastic **PA**\ rallel **R**\ arefied-gas
   **T**\ ime-accurate **A**\ nalyzer. SPARTA is a parallel DSMC or Direct
   Simulation Monte Carlo code for performing simulations of low-density gases
   in 2d or 3d. Particles advect through a hierarchical Cartesian grid that
   overlays the simulation box. The grid is used to group particles by grid cell
   for purposes of performing collisions and chemistry. Physical objects with
   triangulated surfaces can be embedded in the grid, creating cut and split
   grid cells. The grid is also used to efficiently find particle/surface
   collisions. SPARTA runs on single processors or in parallel using
   message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation
   domain. The code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
   functionality.
